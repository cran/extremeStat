
extremeStat ToDo-list / wishlist / issues
- distLprint: possibly change to print method for dlf objects with personal class
- read all of https://www.ine.pt/revstat/pdf/rs120102.pdf and coles (2001)
- if lmomco parkap is changed, change distLfit:154 and distLgof:154 (or leave it...)
- distLextreme correct RP for POT approach

Any feedback is welcome, per email or on github.com/brry/extremeStat
---------------------------------------


Version 0.6.0 (2016-12-12)
For complete log, see https://github.com/brry/extremeStat/commits/master
- several lmomco changes reflected
- several rare errors (especially with very small sample sizes) captured
- documentation updated, vignette clarified
- distLextreme truncate bug corrected (was not passed to distLfit)
- Licence made less restrictive (GPL3 changed to GPL>=2)
- q_gpd captures (and reflects on) more potential errors
- distLquantile q_gpd rownames are unified and sorted differently
- distLgofPlot gained more customization options

Version 0.5.15 (2016-05-11)
submitted to CRAN
various changes, see github commit log at
https://github.com/brry/extremeStat/commits/master
highlights:
- package has a vignette and is Roxygenized
- quantile estimation now possible, function tested and expanded thoroughly
- POT method (truncation parameter) introduced
- GPD quantile comparison across 7 R packages
- failed parameter fitting is handled much better, warning messages became useful
- quiet argument added throughout the package
- several defaults were improved 
- documentation was updated and enhanced, including comments in code
- distLgof now returns weights calculated by 3 different methods
- distLplot now uses supdist, package depends on lmomco >=2.1.3 (version that includes supdist)
- installB: moved to https://github.com/brry/installB to remove devtools dependency here

new functions: distLextremePlot, distLprint, distLquantile, q_gpd
renamed distLgofPlot for consistency in lowerCamel-derived case usage.


---------------------------------------
---------------------------------------


Version 0.4 (2014-12-04)
depends on berryFunctions again (maintaning functions twice is nonsense)
- distLgof now has ks and quiet argument
- distLplot now has las and ylab arguments
- distLfit gained quiet argument


---------------------------------------
---------------------------------------


Version 0.3 (2014-09-30)
independent from berryFunctions now.
Thus I included lim0, logAxis, logVals, owa, rainbow2, rmse, rsquare


---------------------------------------
---------------------------------------


Version 0.2 (2014-09-22)
First version submitted to CRAN, was not accepted.
Documentation slightly refined here and there
changed all "cat" to "message"
added datname element in dlf, used for main and xlab in all suitable plots

- distLplot:
# log=TRUE now works properly, as it just draws logAxis
# logargs argument added
# PDF lines now truncated to support region of distribution
# plots with xlim outside of support region now possible without error
# new default for color vector
# density plot now with lim0
# if(percentline), a vartical dashed line at gofProp is drawn

- distLgof:
# plot default is now TRUE

- distLfit
#distLgof is now explicitly called with plot=FALSE

- distLgofplot:
# received a bunch of graphic arguments
# 'order' and 'add' arguments added

Initial build with the functions:
distLextreme (replacing berryFunctions::extremeStatLmom)
distLfit
distLplot
distLgof
distLgofplot
