
extremeStat ToDo-list / wishlist / issues
- read all of https://www.ine.pt/revstat/pdf/rs120102.pdf and coles (2001)
- distLextreme, distLquantile, q_gpd: reduce example section, potentially move some to tests. add Nile, rain, danish
- split up q_gpd into f_gpd, p/q/d/r_gpd and comp_gpd
- distLexBoot (+plot) conf.lev vectorization
- distLquantile and g_gpd: reference to vignette POT

extremeStat Package by Berry Boessenkool, berry-b@gmx.de
Any feedback is welcome, per email or on github.com/brry/extremeStat
---------------------------------------

Version 1.4.0 (2017-11-02)
- printL improved
- distLexBoot now uses npy
- distLextreme can now use truncate
- examples improved
- deprecated functions are now entirely removed

---------------------------------------
---------------------------------------


Version 1.3.0 (2017-01-26)
Package thoroughly cleaned up and restructured:
- plot functions renamed to common syntax plotL***
- distLgof integrated into distLfit, but weight part moved into distLweights
- q_gpd now computes RMSE as well
- distLextreme can now use POT approach with argument npy
- fitting failure checks now more extensive + all concentrated in distLfit
- failure outputs and messages have been improved
- computing functions do not plot anymore (for more clarity and reproducibility)
- more code is now formally tested with testthat
- gofProp option completely removed (POT support is very good now)
- order option now available throughout the package
- more line breaks in source code for better readibility
- on.exit calls changed to immediate messages
- distLquantile gains sanity checks
- weightp dataset included
- extensive use of berryFunctions::tryStack to trace errors and warnings
- several arguments removed and some renamed
- documentation more standardized, vignette expanded

For all changes, see

new functions: distLweights, q_weighted, plotLquantile
removed: distLgof
renamed: distLprint -> printL, 
         distLextremePlot -> plotLextreme, 
         distLgofPlot -> plotLweights, 
         distLplot -> plotLfit

Version 0.6.0 (2016-12-12)
For complete log, see https://github.com/brry/extremeStat/commits/master
- several lmomco changes reflected
- several rare errors (especially with very small sample sizes) captured
- documentation updated, vignette clarified
- distLextreme truncate bug corrected (was not passed to distLfit)
- Licence made less restrictive (GPL3 changed to GPL>=2)
- q_gpd captures (and reflects on) more potential errors
- distLquantile q_gpd rownames are unified and sorted differently
- distLgofPlot gained more customization options

Version 0.5.15 (2016-05-11)
submitted to CRAN
various changes, see github commit log at
https://github.com/brry/extremeStat/commits/master
highlights:
- package has a vignette and is Roxygenized
- quantile estimation now possible, function tested and expanded thoroughly
- POT method (truncation parameter) introduced
- GPD quantile comparison across 7 R packages
- failed parameter fitting is handled much better, warning messages became useful
- quiet argument added throughout the package
- several defaults were improved 
- documentation was updated and enhanced, including comments in code
- distLgof now returns weights calculated by 3 different methods
- distLplot now uses supdist, package depends on lmomco >=2.1.3 (version that includes supdist)
- installB: moved to https://github.com/brry/installB to remove devtools dependency here

new functions: distLextremePlot, distLprint, distLquantile, q_gpd
renamed distLgofPlot for consistency in lowerCamel-derived case usage.


---------------------------------------
---------------------------------------


Version 0.4 (2014-12-04)
depends on berryFunctions again (maintaning functions twice is nonsense)
- distLgof now has ks and quiet argument
- distLplot now has las and ylab arguments
- distLfit gained quiet argument


---------------------------------------
---------------------------------------


Version 0.3 (2014-09-30)
independent from berryFunctions now.
Thus I included lim0, logAxis, logVals, owa, rainbow2, rmse, rsquare


---------------------------------------
---------------------------------------


Version 0.2 (2014-09-22)
First version submitted to CRAN, was not accepted.
Documentation slightly refined here and there
changed all "cat" to "message"
added datname element in dlf, used for main and xlab in all suitable plots

- distLplot:
# log=TRUE now works properly, as it just draws logAxis
# logargs argument added
# PDF lines now truncated to support region of distribution
# plots with xlim outside of support region now possible without error
# new default for color vector
# density plot now with lim0
# if(percentline), a vartical dashed line at gofProp is drawn

- distLgof:
# plot default is now TRUE

- distLfit
#distLgof is now explicitly called with plot=FALSE

- distLgofplot:
# received a bunch of graphic arguments
# 'order' and 'add' arguments added


---------------------------------------
---------------------------------------


Version 0.1 (2014-09-15)
Initial build with the functions:
distLextreme (replacing berryFunctions::extremeStatLmom)
distLfit
distLplot
distLgof
distLgofplot
